# Overview
For this project we shall be analysing the tmdb_movies.csv dataset. The data set collates data from over 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue


# Conclusions 
From the explorative analysis done, here are the findings:

There has been an explosion in the production of movies for the past three decades(from the 1980's). Possibly owing to the advances in technology.
Although there has been an increase in the revenue generated per decade, overall consumer satisfaction from movies seem to be on the decline.


# Limitations
From the explorative analysis done, here are the findings:

There is need to consider what genre's might be contributing to this dissatisfaction/satisfaction. Hence further in depth research needs to be performed on a genre-by-genre basis.


The revenue adjusted column showed some miscalculations and as such handicapped the use of the column which was intended to take rate of inflation into account.
